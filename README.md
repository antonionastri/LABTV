## General info
The project consists of a sample of a site for streaming movies and TV series (es. netflix, prime video)

## Description
The choice of colors and the type of layout to use was at my discretion. Every movie and TV series has its own 
information in a JSON file that is retrieved based on the movie button pressed. The information includes
a brief synopsis, the year, the duration, the IMdb rating and, in the case of TV series, the number of seasons and episodes.
In the Login form I managed the possible errors through RegExp and the appearance of graphic "alerts", being in a
purely Front-End training forms do not send data to any server.
